邀请好友了,为什么没获得红包?</h5>\n      <span>先检查下您是否在同一设备上进行的邀请?或者被邀请人是否通过您发给对方的链接进行注册?而非自己复制链接注册的。同一设备上邀请或没有按照点击发送的链接邀请都是无效邀请。如果您是正常邀请没获得红包,可以致电客服进行查实。</span>\n      <h5>Q8: 预定早餐、预定午餐的红包怎么使用?在哪里查询?</h5>\n      <span>预定早餐、预定午餐的红包暂时不支持直接点外卖使用,并且当前点外卖的红包也暂时不支持在预定早餐、预定午餐时使用。</span>\n      <h5>Q9: 互斥红包怎么使用?</h5>\n      <span>互斥红包不与其他优惠活动(包含但不限于:新用户专享、满X元减X元、满X元赠XX)同时使用。</span>\n      <h5>Q10: 返红包活动, 红包领取规则是什么?</h5>\n      <span>同一个手机号一天限领取三个。<br>同意注册用户一天限领取三个。<br>注册用户红包直接发送至用户账户里。<br>非注册用户红包以兑换码短信的形式发送至用户手机,注册后凭兑换码兑换即可。<br>红包的使用周期为1周,自红包发放的第2天开始计算。<br>同一个手机号一天最多使用两个红包。<br>未收到红包短信的用户注意查看手机里的拦截短信。<br>有任何问题请拨打客服电话:
